I have a BA in Political Science & History which led me to a good job in the DC area (I now work remotely for them in Florida) but I've advanced as far as I'm going to without any further education.  While I was looking into Master's Certificates and various other ways to do that, I learned about coding bootcamps.  I didn't think much of the idea at first but as I kept considering how to proceed my mind kept taking me back to the boot camp idea... learn a solid skill relatively fast and be able to apply it immediately.  In my mind, what I'd do with a formal master's certificate was a lot more abstract and I just wasn't as comfortable with that.  

I didn't randomly choose coding.  When I was a kid I loved the behind the scenes stuff with computers.  An aunt donated an old 386-based Compaq desktop to me sometime in the mid-90s and I was in love with it (and all it's 4 megabytes of RAM :).  I wanted to be able to create content on the web so I fired up my 14.b bps modem and found a dictonary-sized webpage on how to write HTML.  Printed it out and before I knew it I was making fan-sites for my favorite movies and TV shows.  Eventually I taught myself a good amount of contemporary code and even did some work in C++ where I made some awesome text games.  It was great fun, but then I graduated high school and for various reasons opted for a BA program and my coding skills all but evaporated.  Here I am 20 years later and I want to get up to speed and hopefully be able to start a career in something I really enjoy doing.  So here I am at Flatiron and loving it so far!
